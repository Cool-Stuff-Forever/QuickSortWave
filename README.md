## Contribution requirements

>I want to work on your project, so how can I do it?
You have some possibilities to improve our repository:
1. fork our repository *to eat it entirely*
2. feel free to create branches and make some pull requests
3. interact with people in discussions to help them

And finally do not forget that there are some issues to do as well! So pull requests with problem solutions are more priveleged than *look at me*-type requests.
